deep learning framework preprocessing wsis with pathml &amp; training pytorch models

# concepts

- labels will be automatically read from filenames
- filenames should be e.g.: "p091-normal.tif" where the dash separates filname and classification group (class)

- label examples:

# todo

- check on & visualize masks with vizBatch
- normalize needs global stds & means
